# Stock & Job Management System

A simple Python desktop application built with Tkinter for managing stock inventory and job checkout/return operations.  
It stores data persistently in a text file (`stock.txt`) with auto-incrementing IDs and quantity tracking.

## Features

- Add new stock items with description and quantity  
- Update stock quantities without removing items  
- Job tab for checking out and returning stock items  
- Stock validation to prevent over-checkout  
- Data saved and loaded automatically from `stock.txt`  

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (with Tkinter).  
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
